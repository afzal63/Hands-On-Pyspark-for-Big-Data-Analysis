## About the Video Course
Data is an incredible asset, especially when there are lots of it. Exploratory data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning all depend on processing and analyzing Big Data at scale. 

How do you go from working on prototypes on your local machine, to handling messy data in production and at scale? 

This is a practical, hands-on course that shows you how to use Spark and it's Python API to create performant analytics with large-scale data. Don't reinvent the wheel, and wow your clients by building robust and responsible applications on Big Data.
